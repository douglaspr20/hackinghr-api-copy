      You will now have access to all the PREMIUM tools we have available (including the new ones coming up!). Please make sure you use everything… thoroughly! There’s a lot of content and features for you.
      </p>
      <p>
      And PLEASE, like really PLEASE, if there is something that isn’t working properly (techy bugs… they happen!), something we can improve, or a tool that you’d love to see and we don’t have, just shoot me an email and let me know about it. I can’t promise that we will move faster than the speed of light (whoops that’s impossible!), but we are pretty fast to fix bugs, improve existing features and create new ones.
