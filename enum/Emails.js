      It is… let me think… ok… WONDERFUL, AMAZING, AWESOME and GREAT that you became a PREMIUM member of the Hacking HR LAB!
      </p>
      <p>
      Thank you so much!

      You will now have access to all the PREMIUM tools we have available (including the new ones coming up!). Please make sure you use everything… thoroughly! There’s a lot of content and features for you.
      </p>
      <p>
      And PLEASE, like really PLEASE, if there is something that isn’t working properly (techy bugs… they happen!), something we can improve, or a tool that you’d love to see and we don’t have, just shoot me an email and let me know about it. I can’t promise that we will move faster than the speed of light (whoops that’s impossible!), but we are pretty fast to fix bugs, improve existing features and create new ones.
